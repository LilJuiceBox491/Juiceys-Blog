        <h3>Chainmail....</h3>
        <hr />
        <p><strong>✨Hi, ʏᴏᴜ ʜᴀᴠᴇ ʀᴇᴄᴇɪᴠᴇᴅ ꜱᴘᴀᴍ! ʟᴇɢᴇɴᴅ sᴀʏs ᴛʜᴀᴛ ɪF ʏᴏᴜ ɢɪᴠᴇ ɪᴛ ᴛᴏ 6 ʀᴀɴᴅᴏᴍ ᴘᴇᴏᴘʟᴇ, ʏᴏᴜ ᴡɪʟʟ ɢᴇᴛ -ˏˋ100ˊˎ- ᴍᴏʀᴇ ʀᴇᴘᴏʀᴛꜱ ꜰᴏʀ ꜱᴘᴀᴍᴍɪɴɢ!! ✨</strong><br><br>Look familiar? It should, it's just a form of chainmail. The only difference is this one is actually accurate.<br><br>I get it, chainmail makes people happy. It can really make someones day, if your in a bad mood, you log onto Scratch, and you see someone calling you awesome, you feel happy! I'm not saying you shouldn't be happy, but is it the best to feel happiest about?Really, it's just someone who got that same message, and posted it on a few random profiles.<br><br>In the end, it's your choice. I don't like chainmail, so when I recieve it, I <i>kindly</i> tell them that it is considered spam and I don't do chainmail. That's the real key of this. If you don't like chainmail, that's fine. Just be nice about it.<br><br>That's all for this one. Just remember, kindness is key.<br><br>Bye!!</p>

        <h3>Why Are You Reading This Blog?</h3>
        <hr />
        <p><strong>This one will start out weird. Please read to the end.</strong><br><br>A lot of times in life, especially on the internet, you don't stop to think <i>why</i>.<br><br>Why are you reading my blog? Is it because you like the content, you like the format, the topics, or you support me? What is it? Why?!<br><br>Why are you spending your time on the internet reading my blog. Why?!<br><br>You probably never wondered these questions, but maybe you should. See, you can't be 100% influenced by what I say. One day I could post a bad influental post and you would still read it. Or would you?<br><br>Basically, what I'm saying, is be careful. The internet is dangerous and you don't know what to expect. No matter why you're reading this blog, you must trust me in some way. I'm not saying don't trust me, I'm just saying don't let me influence you in a bad way. I won't do it on purpose but if I do, stop yourself. Don't look up to me or anything, I'm the same as you. Just a person sitting at their computer.<br><br>So be careful what you do with what you hear on the internet. Don't believe everything you hear, and don't follow it. If you disagree with something I see, feel free to reach out and we can have a conversation, or just have your own opinion. Don't bend your opinion to fit mines just because I have half a thousand followers, or I seem like a nice person. Those mean nothing, so just remember: You Are In Charge Of Yourself.<br><br>Also, yeah two posts in one day =)<br><br>That's it for this post. Remember to be yourself and stay safe on the internet. Bye!!</p>

        <h3>What Is Markdown, It's Usefulness, And Why You Should Use It</h3>
        <hr />
        <p>Markdown. A lot of you have at least heard of it. But what is it? Why is it useful? Why should you use it?<br><br>Markdown is 'a plain text formatting syntax aimed at making writing for the internet easier'. In other words, it's fancy symbols you squish in the middle of your text to make it <i><strong>fancy</strong></i>.<br><br>That doesn't make it useless though. Many long text inputs for applications of any sort on the internet support Markdown, so take advantage of it! Learn markdown (it is really simple), and impress your friends/family/colleagues with your <i><strong>fancy</strong></i> text skills.<br><br>Markdown is really simple. Just learn a few basic symbols that you wrap your text in, and voila! You are a markdown genius!<br><br>One more commonly used place of Markdown is README.md's. Many open-source repos have a README file in markdown to teach the reader/viewer what their project is and how to use it.<br><br>All in all, Markdown is useful. It doesn't take too much effort to learn, and it'll pay off when you need it.<br><br>That's it for todays post. Really hope you guys are enjoying! Stay safe! See you in the next one.</p>

        <h3>My Thoughts On Scratch to JavaScript</h3>
        <hr />
        <p>News has been floating around lately about Scratch adding a JavaScript feature. A button that you click that converts your block code to JavaScript. This is because people say Scratch isn't great for learning what's known as 'real programming'.<br><br>I think this is a pretty cool idea. I mean, imagine if you could take your beloved Scratch code and turn it into useful JavaScript! However, my opinion is sort of biased, if you will.<br><br>I am a JavaScript programmer, so for me this feature would be vrey useful, but for many others, is it that useful? No. Many Scratcher's wouldn't even <i>use</i> this feature. So is it worth the effort to create for only a small amount of people using it?<br><br>My final decision is YES. The people who would use this a lot (like me), would love it! It would change the way we used Scratch entirely. Something like this in the Scratch 4.0 update can really help bring Scratch's old hype back up and prepare young coders for the future of programming.<br><br>Well that's my first blog post! I really hope you guys enjoy reading! More content coming soon like always. Stay safe, peace.</p>
